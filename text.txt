Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, O Lord,
and I shall be clean:
Thou shalt wash me,
and I shall be whiter than snow.
Ps. Have mercy upon me, O God,
after Thy great goodness;
according to the multitude of Thy mercies,
do away mine offences.
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,
and to the Holy Ghost:
as it was in the beginning,
is now, and ever shall be,
world without end. Amen.
Thou shalt purge me...
