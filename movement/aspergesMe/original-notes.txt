It says Vatican II Hymnal (July 2011) has Asperges Me settings.

For Asperges me in neumes, see: http://romaaeterna.jp/liber1/lu0011.html

The below represents the version used by two Anglo-Catholic churches in
Baltimore, Maryland (United States), as of 2011: Grace & St Peter's Church and
Mt. Calvary Church.

Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, O
Lord, and I shall be clean: Thou
shalt wash me, and I shall be whi-
ter than snow. *Ps.* Have mercy upon me, O God,
after Thy great goodness; according
to the multitude of Thy mercies, do away
mine offences. Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost:
as it was in the beginning, is now, and e-
ver shall be, world without end. Amen.
Thou shalt purge me...
